    summary: |
      I'm a guy who is not the biggest fan of sitting around but I also enjoy learning new things like coding.
      I am ready to enter a new stage of my life and I am excited to keep going as a paramedic as well.
      I like to hike and do outdoors stuff but a good book and videogame is also good.
